            <span class="text4">Programs are used for an infinity of purposes such as building a website or creating an app.
                                The most important thing in programming is to know where you want to go, the main goal of your project.<br>
                                To start, the first thing you want to ask yourself is: "Which programming language is the most appropriate for my situation?"
                                In this case, you have a ton of choices, but it all depends on what you want to do. 
                                For example, if you want to create a website, you can use html and css.<br>
                                After that, you will want to make a plan of what you should do in order to achieve your goal(s). 
                                As a matter of fact, it is always better to be well organized in order not to miss things. 
                                If not done, your code could not run and display error (in the worst case senario). <br>
                                And then, what else? In the best senario (when your code runs perfectly), you can always try to simplify it in order to make it easier to read.
                                But when you code does not run, you have to debug it in order to find where the error is (this step can take a very long time but it pays). 
                                For example, when you code in C++, you can implement tests.
